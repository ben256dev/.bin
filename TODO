write script to open github repo in browser using with browser command in buc
possibly write a separate command for github link formatting and get rid of gc by making gc and gt the same command
fix gt and buc to allow for certain directories to be ignored
delete .nvm TODO file
list available github repos using github api and show which are cloned already
list of repositories to search and manage with gt, instead of searching everything recursively which is slow, add to list with every gc
gt sort repos by user
gc'd repos can contain a init.gc file to run a bash script that intializes everything in the project (and then deletes itself)
gt option to edit todos with buc_editor field and add modified todos with git commit automatically
instead of removing options, mark them complete somehow and reflect his in the automatic markdown styling, then after committed, the completed items can dissapear
